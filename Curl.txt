Functional safety systems do this by lowering the \nprobability of undesired events, so that mishaps are minimized when operating \nmachinery. Safety standards define safety as freedom from unacceptable risk. \nAcceptable risk levels are defined by means of required risk reduction in the \nmachinery safety standards. Machine builders should always use the same \n(the most stringent) acceptability criteria for all market areas, regardless of regional differences.\nThe most effective way to eliminate risks is to design machines to be inherently \nsafe. But if risk reduction by design is not possible or practical, safeguarding \nthrough static guards or safety functions is often the best option. Machine safety \nfunctions can be used to reduce the risks caused by movement while maintainingmachine productivity, uptime and usability. At the same time, the legal obligations \nare met and the safety of people and the environment is ensured.\nFunctional safety in machinery usually means systems that safely monitor and, \nwhen necessary, take control of the machine applications to ensure safe operation. \nFunctional safety systems are designed to detect hazardous conditions or user’s \ndemand for safe state, and bring machine /process to a safe state, or to ensure that \nthe desired action, such as safe stopping, takes place.\nMonitoring typically include speed, stopping, direction of rotation, and standstill. \nWhen the safety system is executing an active safety function, for example moni -\ntoring a crawl speed, and the system behavior deviates from what is expected (for example, the system runs too fast), the safety system detects the deviation\nand actively brings machine operation to a safe state. This can be done, for \nexample, by stopping the machine safely and removing the torque from the \nmotor shaft.\nA safety system is not part of standard control system of the machine, and any \nfailure in the safety system will immediately increase the risks related to machine.\nThis could lead in to hazardous situation as, the machine might still work normally, \nbut the safety function might not be functional when it is needed. Especially in \nthe high risk applications, safety system must be redundant or at least monitored, \nso that faults in the safety system can't lead to hazardous situation.","source_pdf":"EN_TechnicalguideNo10_REVF.pdf","page":7,"score":0.6141262969505683},{"text":"MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5\nSafety related control systems for machinery\n16The “point of operation” is the area on a machine where work is actually performed \nupon the material being processed.

Machines can cause a variety of injuries ranging from minor abrasions, burns or cuts to severe injuries such as fractures, laceraƟons, crushing injuries or \neven amputa Ɵon. Machine guards \nare your ﬁrst line of defense \nagainst injuries caused by machine operaƟon. Each machine must have \nadequate safeguards to protect operators and other employees in the immediate work area from hazards created by ingoing nip points, rota Ɵng parts, sparks and \nﬂ ying debris. \nPinch points and shear points would include power transmission apparatuses such as: ﬂywheels, pulleys, belts, chains, couplings, spindles, cams, gears, connecƟng rods and other machine components that transmit energy. Having an understanding of how a machine works, and how the guards can protect you, will result in a reduced risk of injury. \nAs an employee you may become \naccustomed to doing things in a certain way or have tasks ﬂ owing a \ncertain way and grow oblivious to the hazards that may be ever present around your piece of equipment. With complacency there is a sense of numbness that develops to hazards. Employees must be on guard and not become complacent in the workplace. \nAll guards should: \nPREVENT CONTACT  – machine \nguards must provide a physical barrier that prevents the operator from having any part of his/her body in the “danger zone” during the machine’s operaƟ ng cycle; \nBE SECURED IN PLACE – machine \nguards must be secure and strong so that workers are not able to bypass, remove, or tamper with them. \nCREATE NO NEW HAZARD  – A \nsafeguard defeats its own purpose if it creates a hazard of its own such as a shear point, a jagged edge, or an unﬁnished surface which can cause a \nlaceraƟon. If possible, one should be \nable to lubricate the machine without removing safeguards. NOT INTERFERE WITH THE MACHINE OPERATION – Any \nsafeguard which impedes a worker from performing the job quickly and comfortably might soon be overridden or disregarded. Proper safeguarding can actually enhance eﬃciency since it can relieve the \nworker’s apprehensions about injury. \nHazardous Mechanical Motions: \nHAZARDOUS MOTIONS – including \nrotaƟng machine parts, reciproca Ɵng \nmoƟons (sliding parts or up/down moƟons), and transverse moƟ ons \n(materials moving in a con Ɵ nuous line); \nPOINTS OF OPERATION – the areas \nwhere the machine cuts, shapes, bores, or bends the stock being fed through it; \nPINCH POINTS AND SHEAR POINTS \n–the area where a part of the body\nor clothing could be caught betweena moving part and a sta Ɵ onary object.\nThere are also non-mechanical hazards that can injure machine operators or personnel working in the vicinity of machinery. These hazards include ﬂ ying splinters, \nchips or debris; splashes, sparks or sprays that are created when the machine is opera Ɵng. These hazards \ncan be prevented through the use of machine guarding and wearing/ use of required personal protec Ɵve \nequipment (PPE). \nAddress,   City, State Zip Code -0000    (877) 555-5555  www.website.com","source_pdf":"Safety Committee Handout 1 Machine Guarding.pdf","page":1,"score":0.5384812495756058}]}

This means that all new machinery must fulfill the same legal \nrequirements when supplied throughout the EU. The same standards (IEC/ISO \nversions) are also recognized in many areas outside Europe, for example through \nequivalency charts, which facilitates machinery trade and machine shipments \nbetween countries within and outside the EU.\nWhy must machinery meet these requirements? Because conformity helps to \nprevent accidents and consequent injury. Furthermore, by complying with the \nMachinery Directive and the relevant harmonized standards or outside Europe \ncomplying with the relevant functional safety standards, machine manufacturers \ncan rest assured they have met their obligations to design and deliver safe \nmachines that comply with national laws.\nFor manufacturers, new and improved safety strategies are becoming a way \nof improving their productivity and competitiveness in the market. The aim of conventional safety systems has been to achieve comprehensive operational \nsafety and meet legal obligations. This has been done by using add-on electrical \nand mechanical components, even at the cost of productivity. Operators can, \nin certain circumstances, override these systems when attempting to improve \nproductivity, which can lead to accidents.\nWith modern safety systems, the safety of the processes and the operator can be \ntaken into account while maintaining productivity. One example of this is keeping \nthe machine running but at a lower speed to maintain safe operation. With modern \nsafety solutions, safety can be an integrated part of machine functionality, and\nsafety solutions are not just afterthoughts, added in order to meet regulations.\nSafety systems can be implemented effectively through defined processes, to \nachieve specific risk reduction capability and use certified subsystems as building \nblocks for safety systems.
